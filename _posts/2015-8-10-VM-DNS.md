title: Enable your VirtualBox DNS
---

I installed VirtualBox on my Mac (10.10.4), and set the network between them as NAT. But there is a probem, the guest host (VM) cannot use the DNS service.

`Notice: these operations should be completed with VM shutdown`


Steps
=====

Three steps can fix this problem: 

1. Register the VM

        VBoxManage registervm /home/user/VirtualBox\ VMs/VMXP/VMXP.vbox 
        
2. Check registered VMs

        VBoxManage -nologo list vms
    
    
3. Get VMs to use host's DNS
    
        VBoxManage modifyvm "Hortonworks Sandbox with HDP 2.2.4.2" --natdnshostresolver1 on
    
4. Start the VM

Or 
        vi /etc/resolv.conf
