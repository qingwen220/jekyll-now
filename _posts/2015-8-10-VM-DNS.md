title: Enable your VirtualBox DNS
---

I installed VirtualBox on my Mac (10.10.4), and set the network between them as NAT. But there is a probem, the guest host (VM) cannot 
use the DNS service. 

Three steps can fix this problem: (Notice: these operations should be completed with VM shutdown)

1. Register the VM
    '''
    VBoxManage registervm /home/user/VirtualBox\ VMs/VMXP/VMXP.vbox 
    // check the vms
    sudo  VBoxManage -nologo list vms
    '''
    
2. Get VMs to use host's DNS
    '''
    VBoxManage modifyvm "Hortonworks Sandbox with HDP 2.2.4.2" --natdnshostresolver1 o
    '''
    
3. Start the VM
